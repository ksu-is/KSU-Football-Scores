# Sports-Score-Ticker
A sports ticker that keeps updated scores of NBA games
## Getting Started

## We will need to find related repository code centering on:
*[ ] Pulling Team Information from a database
 [ ] Saving User Data Input

Each of these aspects will lend themselves to the final product of the processes of our application.

## Road Map 
### Upcoming Tasks for Each Team Member:
Horace 

[X] Set up README
[X] Find at least 1 related repository & add to our project
[ ] Test existing repositories for accuracy, relevancy, and functionality
[ ] Make edits to new repositories
[ ] Report any issues encountered, progress made
[ ] Develop at least half a page of code writing/edits in personal repository

Add new tasks to the Road Map as needed* 

### Deployment
Our application will be functional and presented to the class at the end of the semester 

## Built With
