# Sports-Score-Ticker
A sports ticker that keeps updated scores of KSU Football Games
## Getting Started

## We will need to find related repository code centering on:
[ ] Pulling KSU Team Information from a database
[ ] Saving User Data Input
[ ] Notification and Alerts
[ ] Updating Calendar Dates Autonomously
[ ] Updating Scores Autonomously 

Each of these aspects will lend themselves to the final product of the processes of our application.

## Road Map 
### Upcoming Tasks for Each Team Member: Logan

[X] Set up README
[X] Find at least 1 related repository & add to our project
[X] Test existing repositories for accuracy, relevancy, and functionality
[X] Make edits to new repositories
[X] Import sports.py to help with game score information
[ ] Report any issues encountered, progress made
[ ] Develop at least half a page of code writing/edits in personal repository
[ ] Learn more about how to import data from Beautiful Soup

Add new tasks to the Road Map as needed*
